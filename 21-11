For next time :

- setting up experimental process to test this algorithm, see what is important to look at
1 : precision
2 : proportion of detection the good nature of a criteria : maybe create new uta_gt function to generate single peaked around 0.4 and 0.6
3 : computation time
4 : put noise in the data (1%, ..., 10%)

- litterature : find some papers (maybe he doesn't know) and come up with

- Redo correctly of the example of the paper of Ghaderi
